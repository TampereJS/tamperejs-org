## Tests

### Is there a way to inform the community about upcoming events?

There should be an efficient way to spread the information about upcoming events in order to get the
maximum benefit from each event for the community and the sponsor.

### Are the monthly events sponsored by different companies?

The monthly meetups should not be sponsored by the same companies, otherwise they start to look like
their recruitment and not community events.
