# Modules

TampereJS is split into smaller modules with clearly defined interfaces and acceptance tests, so
that each module can be iterated individually and separately.

## Module structure

Each module should contain following parts:

- Short description of the module itself
- Short description of the purpose of the module
- List of interfaces between modules
- Tests to determine if change can be approved
