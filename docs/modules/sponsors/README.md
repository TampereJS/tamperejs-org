# Sponsors -module

Since the community does not directly handle money, the community needs sponsors for any potential
investments (events, stickers etc.). The sponsor relationships should be cultivated for timely
access to investments when needed.

## Purpose

Purpose of the sponsors is to enable any investments the community might need, such as event
locations, refreshments & food, stickers or any other good or commonities.

## Interfaces

### Available investments

Contact or details of any sponsors that might be interested of sponsoring the community at any given
time.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies.

## Tests

### Is there a clear benefit for a sponsor?

In order to get sponsors the benefits that they get should be clear for everyone.

### Is the sponsor communication done the best way possible?

The sponsors and relationships with them are one of the three pillars for TampereJS, so they
must be handled with care and with best possible way.

### Are the sponsor details secured for limited access?

The managing of sponsors and their contact details should be done in secure fashion so that their
information, contact details etc. are not leaked to the public.

### Is is possible for the rest of the community to securely reach to sponsors in a timely manner?

When needed, the community should be able to reach to a sponsor for potential investment without 
needing an access to the details meant for limited access. This should happen as quickly as
possible.

### Are any of the sponsors getting only the relevant information they need?

Sponsors should be only be contacted in such a way that they only need to react to relevant
information (no duplicates, no unrelated emails etc.).
