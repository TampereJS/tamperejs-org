The master plan how to achieve the mission:

1. Set up a web tech community and regular meetups
2. Use that to spread web tech knowledge
3. Use that to enable individuals, companies and **new startups**
4. Get them to share what new they have learned. Rinse, repeat.

**Bonus:** Make it fun while doing all of the above.

## Working on a change proposal

Work on any change proposal should be done in a group (mob)

1. Form a group (mob) of 3-5 people to address the issue
2. Make sure everyone in the group agrees to the definition and the value it is delivering towards
the mission
3. Come up with solution in 20 minutes or less (does not include implementation), prefer doing over
planning

If the change requires implementation, work on it as a group. Document the process after each
session to the GitHub issue.

**Bonus:** While doing the above, keep asking if this is the most optimal way of achieving the value described
by the the change proposal.
